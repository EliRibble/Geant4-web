		This website is dedicated to helping students with NASA's Exploration Design Challenge (EDC). It  runs off of GEANT4, which is software that models individual particles and rays. We programmed GEANT4 to be able to process not just initial radiation shielding, but shielding from the daughter products of the interactions of the environmental radiation with the radiation shielding.
The server runs (X NUMBER) particles through the selected thicknesses of the selected shielding. Tracking each interaction, GEANT4 measures the total dose and total energy deposit at succeeding depths into a phantom modeling an astronaut, reporting the radiation exposure as a percentage of the exposure without shielding. Dose radiation is more indicitive of biological harm, as energy deposition includes energy from biologically insignificant sources, like low-frequency electromagnetic radiation.
With this program, students will be able to have a quantitative analysis of the efficacy of different shielding materials, instead of conjecture-driven estimates. Students can also better balance the increased effect of more shielding with the increased cost of moving it into space.
To test 3 layers, select the shielding material and thickness from the drop down menu for each layer. If you want to test additional layers, click in the “Add a layer” button. Your results will be exported as a graph.
