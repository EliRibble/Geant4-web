Geant4-web
==========

A web interface for using Geant4 for radiation simulations
The goal of this is to allow anyone to run radiation protection simulations without having to do all the work involved with setting up Geant4 and running it. Right now what needs to be done is to allow adding and removing of layers, sending the necessary data, graphing the data, displaying what the user has chosen, and maybe an interactive loading screen for the user to play with while their input is being processed.
